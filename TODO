* Per-service configuration, probably using a parallel array for each of the
  services we care about.  Could get messy UI-wise.
* Probing for NIS servers and domains using broadcast RPC (servers can be done
  by calling the NULL function for the ypserv program, and Cristian says one of
  the RPCs will let me query the domain the server supports).  To be added as a
  button for one-time use.
* Probing DNS for Kerberos and LDAP configuration.  To be added as a button
  for one-time use.
* Enabling DNS-based configuration at run-time for Kerberos.
* Make it clear that no server set for NIS forces "use broadcast".  Probably
  need to reintroduce that checkbox.
* Make it clear that no server set for LDAP forces "use DNS".  Probably needs
  a checkbox.
* Go from hard-coded knowledge of whether or not a module is applicable to
  a service to checking the module file itself for the appropriate function.
* Glob /lib/libnss_{libc-version}*.so for a list of possible services, and
  hide others?
* Hide LDAP and Kerberos authentication if modules for PAM not already present?
* An easy-to-parse way to dump what we think the current configuration is (for
  anaconda to use if we want to add probing at install-time).
* Add a "db" checkbox under nss configuration to improve speed on single
  lookups, add it first in the list, and run "make -C /var/db" on exit.

No way this stuff's going to fit onto two screens....
