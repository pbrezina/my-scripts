Bite the bullet and do PAM configuration the Hard Way.  (Using pam_stack to
sidestep the thorniness of this problem was a hack.)
  * Per-service configuration, probably using a parallel array for each of the
    services we care about.  Experimental model in authconfig.conf in this
    directory.  Needs to be expandible using only configuration data.  Probably
    will use alchemist for the final setup, because I hate writing parsers now.
  * Go from hard-coded knowledge of whether or not a module is applicable to
    a service to checking the module file itself for the appropriate function.

Probing:
  * Enabling DNS-based configuration at run-time for Kerberos.
    - Set "dns_lookup_realm", "dns_lookup_kdc", "dns_fallback" to "true".  We
      currently don't even look at these settings.
  * Probing DNS for Kerberos and LDAP configuration.  To be added as a button
    for one-time use.
    - Use SRV RRs for LDAP, a la nss_ldap:
      _ldap._tcp.<DOMAIN> = priority weight port server (see RFC 2782)
      Convert <DOMAIN> to base DN using DC components in the way just
      about everything does (example.com -> "dc=example,dc=com")
    - Use TXT RRs for host-to-realm mapping (see latest
      draft-ietf-krb-wg-krb-dns-locate at http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/)
    - Use SRV RRs for Kerberos realms, a la locate_kdc.c:
      _kerberos._udp.<REALM> = priority weight port server (see RFC 2782)
      We have the realm, a server name, and the port number.  Use all of them.
      _kerberos-master._udp.<REALM> = priority weight port server (see RFC 2782)
      We have the realm, the admin server name, and the port number.
  * Probing for NIS servers and domains using broadcast RPC (servers can be done
    by calling the NULL function for the ypserv program, and we've only got
    YPPROC_DOMAIN for checking if a server supports a given domain).  To be
    added as a button for one-time use.
  * An easy-to-parse way to dump what we think the current configuration is (for
    anaconda to use if we want to add probing for default options at
    install-time).

UI issues:
  * Make it clear that no server set for NIS forces "use broadcast".  Probably
    need to reintroduce that checkbox.
  * Make it clear that no server set for LDAP forces "use DNS".  Probably needs
    a checkbox.
  * Make no settings for Kerberos force "use DNS", as above.
  * Glob /lib/libnss_{libc-version}*.so for a list of possible services, and
    hide others?
  * Hide LDAP/Kerberos/SMB authentication if modules for PAM not already
    present?

New options:
  * Add a "db" checkbox under nss configuration to improve speed on single
    lookups, add it first in the lists, and run "make -C /var/db" on exit.

If all of this gets done, there's no way it's going to fit onto two screens....
